## Setup

### Environment
We manage our environments with `uv` to ensure reproducibility, portability, and ease of use.
Install `uv` [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended), or run `pip install uv`/`brew install uv`.
We recommend reading a bit about managing projects in `uv` [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/#managing-dependencies) (you will not regret it!).

You can now run any code in the repo using
```sh
uv run <python_file_path>
```
and the environment will be automatically solved and activated when necessary.

### Run unit tests


```sh
uv run pytest
```

### Download data
Download the TinyStories data and a subsample of OpenWebText

``` sh
bash download_data.sh
```
